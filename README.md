# weather-api
USAGE:
 a weather api built to get you the latest weather information from trusted forecasters.
 enter the name of the place you want to search about and get stats like latitude, longitude, tenperature etc.

SOFTWARE:
simple project built using openweathermap's API key. Realtime info obtained from the site itself and retrieved using 2 functions geocode(that returns in latitude and longitude) and 
forecast that returns temperature and weather. I had trouble finding the right and easy to use API and stumbled upon many weather forecasting websites before choosing this as the json 
data displaced is useful and easy to read and the API use is easy.The function geocode took a long time to work as it was difficult to retrieve data correctly from unparsed weather info
given by open weather app. I installed a chrome extension that parses data to make that easier.I also had difficulties in exporting the geocode and forecast modules correctly.
